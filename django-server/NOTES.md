# Notes

## Testing
Tests in django are executed with `manage.py test` command. This performs a process that is roughly:
- finds subclasses of `django.test.TestCase` to create a test suite
    - looks for test methods
- creates a test database, using the DB settings in `settings.py` (i.e. creates a test database in the configured server)

There's an integration to run tests with pytest, giving tools such as fixtures and so forth - `pytest-django`. A blog post on this topic - https://djangostars.com/blog/django-pytest-testing/

**TODOs**
- run integration tests with pytest. These tests should not belong to the `polls` app as integration tests are of the domain/service itself
and not just of the `polls` app
    - the tests should cover the simple API

## Django Database ORM

### Foreign Key contraint names
When using `models.ForeignKey`, the constraint name generated by django contains some kind of hash:

`polls_choice_question_id_c5b4b260_fk_polls_question_id` 

No clue on what `c5b4b260` is supposed to be.

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey says nothing about it.

The only thing I found out while searching for a way to control this naming was (however not useful):
